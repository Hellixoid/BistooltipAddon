LibExtraTipStartup

LibExtraTip is a library of API functions for manipulating additional information into GameTooltips by either adding information to the bottom of existing tooltips (embedded mode) or by adding information to an extra "attached" tooltip construct which is placed to the bottom of the existing tooltip.

LibExtraTip is composed of multiple files:
LibExtraTipStartup.lua - startup checks and lib setup
LibExtraTipHandler_DataProc.lua - only one of the Handler files will load, depending on available Client APIs
LibExtraTipHandler_HookSet.lua
LibExtraTip.lua - main code file
LibMoneyFrame.lua - routines for handling display of money values
Load.xml - loads the lua files in the above order

local LOAD_FAIL = 15			-- optional condition to be set if a failure is detected during loading; should block transition to LOAD_COMPLETE
local LOAD_COMPLETE = 20		-- set at end of file, only set if status was LOAD_START; flags that file has loaded without error

local ACTIVATE_START = 45		-- set at start of file's Activate function; blocks re-entry of the Activate function (optional for trivial Activate functions)
local ACTIVATE_FAIL = 50		-- optional condition to be set if a failure is detected during Activate; should block transition to ACTIVATE_COMPLETE
local ACTIVATE_COMPLETE = 55	-- set at end of file's Activate function; all file statuses need to be in this state to allow the Lib to fully Activate

Usage of filetrackerX status variables

1) At head of file:

<include a copy of the above constants>

if status.filetrackerX ~= LOAD_NEW then return end
status.filetrackerX = LOAD_START

2) At tail of file:

if status.filetrackerX == LOAD_START then status.filetrackerX = LOAD_COMPLETE end

3) At head of file's Activate function:

if status.filetrackerX ~= LOAD_COMPLETE then return end
status.filetrackerX = ACTIVATE_START

4) At tail of Activate function:

if status.filetrackerX == ACTIVATE_START then status.filetrackerX = ACTIVATE_COMPLETE end

Optional: for a trivial Activate function, must still check for LOAD_COMPLETE state
but may then jump directly to ACTIVATE_COMPLETE without going through ACTIVATE_START

Note:
lib:IsActive() checks the filetrackerX status for every file, returns true if ALL are at ACTIVATE_COMPLETE
